Implementation and examples for the manuscript "RAD-Median and trimmed mean, new multivariate generalizations of the classical estimators".


Many statistical concepts are defined in the one-dimensional setting. It is not always clear how to generalize these concepts to higher dimensions. There are many multivariate generalizations of the median which are equivalent to the well-known one-dimensional median in the case of univariate data. Multivariate medians found in the literature lack desirable properties, such as being hard to compute for high dimensional data, or not having rotational invariance. We propose new multivariate estimators, RAD-Median and Zt-Mean, as generalizations of the one-dimensional sample median and trimmed mean, respectively, noting that the median is a special case of the trimmed mean.

Here we compute the RAD-Median:
